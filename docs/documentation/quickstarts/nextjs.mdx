This quick start guide will get you up and running with Trigger.dev.

<Accordion title="Need to create a new Next.js project to add Trigger.dev to?">
No problem, create a blank project by running the `create-next-app` command in your terminal then continue with this quickstart guide as normal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Trigger.dev works with either the Pages or App Router configuration.

<Step title="Run the CLI `dev` command">

The CLI `dev` command allows the Trigger.dev service to send messages to your site. This is required for registering Jobs, triggering them and running tasks. To achieve this it creates a tunnel (using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)) so Trigger.dev can send messages to your machine.

You should leave the `dev` command running when you're developing.

In a **new terminal window or tab** run:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx @trigger.dev/cli@latest dev
```

</CodeGroup>
<br />
<Note>
  You can optionally pass the port if you're not running on the default port by adding
  `--port 3001` to the end.

<Accordion title="Experiencing an error? This could be due to middleware.">

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced: Run your Next.js server together with the CLI">
You can modify your `package.json` to run both the Next.js server and the CLI `dev` command together.

1. Install the `concurrently` package:

  <CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install concurrently --save-dev
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install concurrently --save-dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn add concurrently --dev
```

</CodeGroup>

2. Modify your `package.json` file's `dev` script.

```json package.json
...
"scripts": {
  "dev": "concurrently --kill-others npm:dev:*",
  "dev:next": "next dev",
  "dev:trigger": "npx @trigger.dev/cli dev",
  //...
}
...
```

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Your first job">

The CLI init command created a simple Job for you. There will be a new file either `src/jobs/examples.(ts/js)` or `jobs/examples.(ts/js)`.

In there is this Job:

<Snippet file="quickstart-example-job.mdx" />

If you navigate to your Trigger.dev project you will see this Job in the "Jobs" section:

![Your first Job](/images/first-job.png)

</Step>

<Snippet file="quickstart-running-your-job.mdx" />

</Steps>
