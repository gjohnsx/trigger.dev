This quick start guide will get you up and running with Trigger.dev.

<Accordion title="Need to create a new Remix project to add Trigger.dev to?">
No problem, create a blank project by running the `create-remix` command in your terminal then continue with this quickstart guide as normal:

```bash
npx create-remix@latest
```

Trigger.dev works with Remix v1 and v2.
